- Start the client with the server IOR as command-line argument.

Java
----
- Install a recent JDK.
- Go into the ./java subdirectory.
- If needed, re-generate stubs and skeletons with "idlj -fall ../echo.idl".
- Call "make" to build the JAR files for client and server.
- Run the server with "java -jar server.jar".

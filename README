These are some primitive examples for CORBA interaction, straight from the OMNIOrb and Java tutorials.
You can run the different client / servers against each other.

Everything is optimized to be minimal, including the Makefile's.

All code was tested on MacOS X Yosemite, with an OMNIOrb installation from Homebrew.

Python
------
- Install OMNIOrb, test that it is available as Python package (import OMNIOrb).
- Go into the ./python subdirectory.
- (Optional) Re-generate stubs and skeletons with "omniorb -bpython ../echo.idl".
- Start the server with "python server.py". It will print the server IOR to be used by the client.
- Start the client with "python client.py <IOR>".

Java
----
- Install a recent JDK.
- Go into the ./java subdirectory.
- (Optional) Re-generate stubs and skeletons with "idlj -fall ../echo.idl".
- Call "make" to build the JAR files for client and server.
- Run the server with "java -jar server.jar".  It will print the server IOR to be used by the client.
- Run the client with "java -jar client.jar <IOR>".

C++
---
- Install OMNIOrb.
- Go into the ./cxx subdirectory.
- (Optional) Re-generate stubs and skeletons with "omniorb -bcxx ../echo.idl".
- Call "make" to build client and server.
